# Description

The aim of this chapter is to present the basic types available in
the language we are trying to learn. Mostly about declaring constants
and variables of algebraic datatypes such as booleans, integers, floats,
strings. In some languages, there might be additional
types such as nil, options, results, union types (enums etc).
